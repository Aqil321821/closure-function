// a function closure 

/* // A closure is a fundamental concept in JavaScript (and other programming languages)
 that refers to a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed 
 outside that scope. In simpler terms, a closure allows a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or 
 environment, even after that scope has finished executing. */
